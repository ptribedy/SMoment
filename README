#To run this code simply do :
$./run

#./run does both complie and run the code "main.C" where inputs are set
#To change inputs modify "main.C"
#Look at the 

"FactMom.h"
#Contains different classes to perform algebra of higher moments

"SMoment.h"
#Contains single class that performs e-by-e analysis of higher moments 

"ToyModel.h"
#Class to generate multiplicity according to different distributions and to simulate efficiency
